# ExpenseManager-ASPCore-EFCore-Highchart
In this article, we will be creating a personal expense manager using Asp.NET Core 2.1 and Entity Framework core Code first approach. An expense manager tracks your daily expenses and provides comparative charts to show expense summary. Since we are using modal dialog to handle user inputs and to show monthly and weekly expense summary chart using Highcharts. Hence this application will be a Single Page Application (SPA) .

We will be using Visual Studio 2017 and SQL Server 2017 for our demo.
